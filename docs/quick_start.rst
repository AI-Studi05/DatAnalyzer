Quick Start
===========

This guide explains how to quick install and run the application, to obtain our
result.

Clone the project
-----------------------
First, you have to clone the project in the directory you want by
copying the following cell.

 .. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/AI-Studi05/DatAnalyzer.git


Create the environment
-----------------------
Once the project is cloned, go at the root of the project "DatAnalyzer" to
set-up the virtual environment. You can do it quickly by running the command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ make welcome

This command will install and activate the virtual environment on your local
machine.

Install the package
-----------------------
When the environment is installed and activate, we can download the packages
by running:

.. code-block:: sh

   $pipenv install

For your reference, the paper tables are repeated below, so you can check the
reproducibility of our solution. Check that the environment is activate.

Running the app
-----------------------------

All the result
=============

From here, the result can be quickly re-generated by running the following
command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $python DatAnalyzer/main.py

Specific Result
=============
In case you want specific result you can specify arguments when running the
scripts. There are 4 arguments:

  - protocols :Random_State1; Random_State_2; Random_State_3
  - model : Linear_Regression; Decision_Tree_Classifier
  - dataset : House; White_wine; Red_wine
  - scaling : max_scaling, z-normalisation, polynomial_features

  In case there is no specification, it will run for all.
  Exemple:

.. code-block:: sh

   $python DatAnalyzer/main.py --protocol Linear_Regression --dataset House
